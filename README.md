Internet-controlled Quadcopter
==============================

How it works:
1. This code must live in the Raspberry Pi
2. SSH into the Raspberry Pi from your laptop ground station
3. Run this server with `python app.py`
4. The server is listening on `localhost:5000`
5. Go to the browser to `localhost:5000` and control the quadcopter from there
